Analyze the given macOS application accessibility screen information and follow these steps:

Determine the type and purpose of the application based on the provided elements and descriptions.
Identify all AXTextField elements present in the structure.
For each AXTextField:
a. Infer its specific purpose within the application context.
b. Consider what current user would input in this field based on accessibility and a common human response.
c. Generate an appropriate example input based on the field's likely function and the app's overall purpose.
Output a JSON object where:

Keys are the integer IDs of the AXTextField elements
Values are realistic and based on the content of the screen. 

Provide only the JSON object as output, without any additional text or explanation.
Example outputs:
{7: "Yellow Submarine"} // For a music app song search
{12: "John", 15: "Smith", 21: "07580198241"} // For a contacts app name field
{8: "main"} // For a search bar in IDE with a Python project looking for main.py
Note: Ensure that the chosen inputs are relevant to the application's purpose and represent realistic user interactions across various types of macOS applications.
