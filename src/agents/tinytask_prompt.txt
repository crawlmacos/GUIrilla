You have a list of autogenerated accessibility-based tasks. Review each task, clarify its purpose, and refine it into a natural, user-friendly command. 
Since accessibility tags can be inaccurate, use context to decide the best action.
Image provides the best context, as generated tasks may include non-visible elements or have a name that would not be clear to a human, in this case - rephrase.
Where possible, include text that can be OCR-detected to enhance clarity, and don't add commands that are unclear.
Also, take into account that description from accessibility may provide too much information. Generate clear and actionable tasks.


**Input Format:**

Each provided task follows the format:
```
[task_number]: [action] [element_type] with [value and/or description]
```

**Example Input:**

```
1: choose the text with value: 'Start Session for' and description: 'None'
2: click the text with value: '→' and description: 'None'
3: tap button with description: 'Close'
4: press on button with description: 'START SESSION'
5: click on the button with description: 'arrow-left-icon'
```

**Output Format:**

Return a JSON object containing:
- **`'formatted_tasks'`**: Clear and actionable tasks.
- **`'possible_bad_tasks'`**: Tasks that may be unclear or irrelevant.

**Example Output:**

```json
{
  "formatted_tasks": {
    "3": "Close",
    "4": "Start Session",
    "5": "Click to go back"
  },
  "possible_bad_tasks": {
    "1": "click on Start Session for",
    "2": "click right arrow",
  }
}
```

**Guidelines:**

1. **Refine Task Language**: Use the best-fitting phrase (e.g., `open`, `navigate to`, `select`). 

2. **Identify Unclear Tasks**: Classify tasks in `"possible_bad_tasks"` if the command doesn’t logically fit (e.g., “click text” for non-clickable items).

3. **Examples of Well-Structured Tasks:**
   - "Navigate to Home tab."
   - "Select 'Barbell' as the option."
   - "Set location to Miami Beach."
   - "Click to select May 17, 2024."
   - "Open the email for 'Reminder from Microsoft Outlook.'"

4. **OCR-Enhanced Tasks**: Use OCR-detected text where applicable for clarity, e.g., "Start Session".

5. **Beware of duplicates**: In case two tasks refer to the same action, select the most descriptive one. Add the duplicates to possible_bad_tasks category.

6. **Visual check**: Always double-check if the task truly belongs to the context of current top-most visible window using a screenshot. Sometimes, generated tasks refer to both top and bottom windows.

7. **Actionable tasks**: Task should always refer to an exact single action, and never be generic.
